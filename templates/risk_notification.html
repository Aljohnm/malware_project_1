                        <p class="card-text">Malware infections can manifest through various warning signs that should not be ignored:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Slow Performance:</strong> Malware often runs background processes, using up system resources and slowing down your device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unusual Pop-ups:</strong> Be on the lookout for frequent or strange pop-ups, especially those claiming you’ve won something or urging you to install software. Common types include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Fake Virus Alerts**: Pop-ups claiming your system is infected and urging you to click a link to "remove the virus." Often these lead to more malware.</li>
                                    <li>**Adware Pop-ups**: Frequent ads for products, services, or suspicious deals, especially when you’re not actively browsing such websites.</li>
                                    <li>**Phishing Pop-ups**: Pop-ups asking for personal information, login credentials, or banking details disguised as legitimate warnings or opportunities.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Frequent Crashes:</strong> If your computer crashes often, shows the "blue screen of death," or has applications freezing randomly, malware might be affecting system stability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unexplained Network Activity:</strong> A sudden increase in data usage or network traffic, especially if your system is idle, could mean malware is communicating with external servers or sending out stolen information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disabled Security Tools:</strong> If your antivirus or firewall is mysteriously disabled without your knowledge, this is a serious sign that malware is trying to protect itself from being removed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Malware Protection Tips</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Implement these essential protection strategies to safeguard your device from malware:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Ensuring your operating system, browsers, and software are up-to-date can prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Install Reliable Antivirus Software:</strong> Use reputable antivirus software like Norton, Kaspersky, or Bitdefender, and schedule regular scans to detect and remove threats.</li>
                            <li><strong>Beware of Suspicious Emails:</strong> Emails are a common vector for spreading malware. Here’s what to watch out for:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Unknown Senders**: Be wary of emails from people you don’t know, especially if they contain attachments or urgent requests.</li>
                                    <li>**Unexpected Attachments**: Even if an email seems legitimate, be cautious of unexpected attachments or links. Common malware carriers include ZIP files, PDFs, and Word documents.</li>
                                    <li>**Urgent Messages**: Emails that threaten account closure or promise big rewards (like winning a lottery you didn’t enter) are often phishing attempts.</li>
                                    <li>**Email Spoofing**: Check for subtle differences in sender email addresses. Attackers often mimic official organizations (e.g., "customer-service@amazon-update.com" instead of "customer-service@amazon.com").</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Secure Your Network:</strong> Use a strong Wi-Fi password and enable encryption (WPA2 or WPA3). Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi, as it’s easier for attackers to intercept data on unsecured networks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regular Data Backups:</strong> Back up your important files to an external hard drive or cloud storage service. In case of a ransomware attack or system crash, you can restore your data without paying a ransom.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Wherever possible, enable 2FA for your accounts. Even if malware steals your password, 2FA can prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                        </ul>
